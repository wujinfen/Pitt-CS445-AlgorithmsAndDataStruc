// Author's DequeInterface with addition of two methods: size()
// and capacity().  I have also slightly changed the behavior of
// the getFront(), getBack(), removeFront() and removeBack() methods
// so that if the deque is empty they will return null rather than
// throwing an exception.  See details below.
